  Create meaningful user interaction targets with support for theme, size and outline
  variants.
</Text>

The Button component is the default element created by the Active.Trigger component, so
the Button component API is available for all elements with an interaction target.

Buttons can be customized with theme color, size and outline variants to provide the exact
styles needed.

- Default button usage expects a theme color

Outline button variants provide low emphasis action targets.
