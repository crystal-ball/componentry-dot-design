<ComponentHeading name='Nav' components={['Nav']} />

<Text variant='lead'>Create navigation sections</Text>

The Nav component creates a nav container that Anchor components are included
in. Pass a truthy `navItem` prop to the Anchor components for flex layouts. Flex
layout props are available on the Nav container for setting Anchor spacing and
direction.

<Nav>
  <Anchor navItem active href='#'>
    Active
  </Anchor>
  <Anchor navItem href='#'>React</Anchor>
  <Anchor navItem href='#'>Redux</Anchor>
  <Anchor navItem href='#' disabled>
    Styles
  </Anchor>
</Nav>

```javascript
<Nav>
  <Anchor navItem active href='#'>
    Active
  </Anchor>
  <Anchor navItem href='#'>React</Anchor>
  <Anchor navItem href='#'>Redux</Anchor>
  <Anchor navItem href='#' disabled>
    Styles
  </Anchor>
</Nav>
```

## A++ A11y

- Nav containers are an HTML `nav` element with a role of `navigation`. They should be
  used for demarcating navigation sections in your application.
- HTML `nav` elements can contain lists (traditional) but also can contain anchors not in
  a list structure. Because both are valid, Componentry defaults to a listless structure
  for maximum flexibility. Additional motivation is from this CSS Tricks analysis:
