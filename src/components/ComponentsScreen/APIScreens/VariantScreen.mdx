# Component `variant` API

Components each have at least one `variant`, which maps to a set of styles. You can create
additional variations if you need multiple styles of a single component, eg you may want a
menu with dense spacing with a button trigger style, and an additional menu for navigation
with loose spacing and a text trigger style.

- The `variant` prop will override the base css class used throughout the component.
- The component behaviors are separated into a separate class so that styles can be
  customized without having to reproduce behaviors.
