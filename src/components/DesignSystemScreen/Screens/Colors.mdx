# Color system

Componentry manages colors in a more flexible way than other libraries. Colors start with
a base set of theme colors (primary, success, etc.) and then individual theme domains
layer specific colors on top of those.

eg Borders: Include the theme-colors and add border-colors.

This allows creating more semantic variables for colors and more options.

## Shades

A dark and light base shade are used to create theme shades and shadows:

```scss
$dark-shade: #151617 !default;
$light-shade: #f0f0f0 !default;
```

### Color sets

- `$grayscale` - The `$grayscale` map includes the shades of gray used in the theme. By
  default values from `'100'` to `'900'` are included.
- `$theme-colors` - The `$theme-colors` map includes the foreground, background and all
  contextual theme colors.
- `$background-colors` - The `$background-colors` map includes all background colors.
- `$border-colors` - The `$border-colors` map includes all border colors.
- `$typography-colors` - The `$typography-colors` map includes all typography colors.

The `$background-colors`, `$border-colors`, and `$typography-colors` maps are convenient
locations to include additional contextual colors. For example if you wanted modals to
have custom border colors you could add a `$modal` value to the `$border-colors` map.
