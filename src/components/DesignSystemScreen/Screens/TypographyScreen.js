        crashed into a beet truck. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with

        Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. My dad once told me, laugh and the

        Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? God help us, we're in the hands
        of engineers. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air,
        and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't
        want it anymore!
