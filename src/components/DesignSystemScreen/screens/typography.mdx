# Typography system

## Type hieararchy

The text hieararchy provides four levels of signifying importance.

- Headings - Use for primary screen headings
- Subheadings - Use for secondary headings
- Body - Use for primary text content
- Small - Use for secondary text context like captions

It is recommended to use these as categories for tracking text variants.

## Responsive typography

Creating responsive typography is easiest using CSS variables and breakpoints. The
following process will create a theme with typography styles targeting small and large
screens.

1. Select a base font size for small screens
