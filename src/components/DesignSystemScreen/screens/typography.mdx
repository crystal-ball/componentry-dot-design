  Yes, Yes, <strong>without</strong> the oops! You know what? It is beets. I've crashed
  into a beet truck. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and
  I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! I gave it a cold? I gave it a
  virus. A computer virus.

## Type hieararchy

The text hieararchy provides four levels of signifying importance.

- Headings - Use for primary screen headings
- Subheadings - Use for secondary headings
- Body - Use for primary text content
- Small - Use for secondary text context like captions

It is recommended to use these as categories for tracking text variants.

## Responsive typography

Creating responsive typography is easiest using CSS variables and breakpoints. The
following process will create a theme with typography styles targeting small and large
screens.

1. Select a base font size for small screens

  Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. My dad once told me, laugh and the world
  laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Yeah,
  but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the
  tourists.

## Radical Components

<p>
  Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? God help us, we're in the hands of
  engineers. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up
  the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

## Display headings

<Text variant='display-1'>Radical</Text>
<Text variant='display-2'>Radical</Text>

---

## Headings

<Text variant='heading-1'>Must go faster</Text>
<Text variant='heading-2'>Must go faster</Text>
<Text variant='heading-3'>Must go faster</Text>

_Componentry supports h1-h5 settings, but recommends breaking typography out into smaller
sets of display, heading, and subtitle elements._

## Subheadings

Subheadings are useful as smaller typography elements for labeling containers within a
screen.

<Text variant='subheading-1'>Must go faster</Text>
<Text variant='subheading-2'>Must go faster</Text>
