## Customizing SASS variables

The Componentry design system can be customized using SASS theme variable overrides as
well as creating custom variants.

Design system theme variables are defined in the Componentry
[`src/styles/_variables.scss`][variables] file. Override any of these values before
importing componentry to customize the generated styles.
