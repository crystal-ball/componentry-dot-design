# Library overview

## Base theming

<Text>
  Styles in componentry use a{' '}
  <Anchor as='a' href='https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/maps'>
    SASS Map
  </Anchor>{' '}
  for the base theme. The theme defines shared design elements such as spacing, palette,
  and typography values. A set of utility styles inspired by{' '}
  <Anchor as='a' href='https://tailwindcss.com/'>
    Tailwind CSS
  </Anchor>{' '}
  is generated using the theme values. Under the hood the library components use the
  utility styles for most of the System props, and the classNames can also be used
  directly.

## Component styles

Componentry styles are written in SASS, but instead of using variables to customize styles
Componentry uses <Anchor as='a' href='https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/maps'>
SASS Maps</Anchor>. Every component has a SASS map that can be overridden at any level.
This provides 100% control over the base styles your application is built on.

## Component variants

Componentry separates CSS styles for component behavior from component appearance.
Component appearance is handled by _variants_, a mechanism that enables creating custom
versions of components to match your design system needs.
