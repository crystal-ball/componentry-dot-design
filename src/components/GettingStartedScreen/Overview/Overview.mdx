- Componentry styles are grouped into utility styles and component styles.
- Utility styles are generated using the application `$theme` values.
- Component styles are generated using per component SASS maps.
- All theme values and component styles can be overridden by defining values in your
  application.

- All components accept System props, Tailwind/Styled System inspired props for setting
  utility style classes.
- Component props can be customized at the application level using the `Theme` component.
