## Items

_On Dropdown.Item, List.Item, Nav.Item_

At this time Item components are not abstracted into some factory because there are enough
differences that it isn't value added.

- Dropdown content by default is not assumed to be a list, Dropdowns may have lists in
  them, but they may also have headers, form elements, text, etc. Interactive dropdown
  items are also most likely to be a button.
- List content is assumed to be a list, but may be a list of text, anchors or buttons.
  Although the default container is a `ul`, it's technically invalid HTML to include
  anything other than an `li` in an unordered list.
- Nav content is assumed to be a set of links, and is not structured as a list. Nav items
  are assumed to be `a` elements within `nav` container that provides some shortcut layout
  options.
