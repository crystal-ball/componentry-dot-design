# Componentry roadmap

### Library

- Universal prop for controlling spacing of elements, eg `density="compact"`
  Instead of creating specific styles, allow users to define as many levels of
  density as they need.

## Buttons

- Button groups and button containers

### Tables

- Example of a table with sorting and windowing.
