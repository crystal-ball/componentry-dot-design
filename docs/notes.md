## Working with TailwindCSS

- When working with Tailwind there are lots of duplicated styles, eg double
  .flex and .flex-column. Docs needs a getting started "Working with Tailwind"
  covering how to import the component styles and not the utility styles.

## Layout

- Provide recommendations and documentation on layout props. Eg, how to define a
  constrained set of layout props, and how to break out of that constrained set
  when needed. Might be something like: 'Use strings for theme spacing values
  and numbers for raw overrides.
